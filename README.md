# Dory

**Agent memory that actually sticks.**

Named after the fish with no short-term memory — because that's your AI agent right now.

Dory is a Python-native, local-first **knowledge graph** memory library for AI agents. Drop it into any LLM pipeline and your agent stops forgetting between sessions.

```python
pip install dory-memory
```

---

## The problem

Every time you start a new session, your agent starts from zero. Even systems that claim to "remember" you are doing keyword search through a flat list of notes. That's not memory — that's ctrl+F.

The deeper problem: naive memory injection makes things *worse*. Dumping everything into context creates noise that degrades model performance. Research ([Chroma, 2025](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot)) shows all major frontier models degrade starting at 500–750 tokens of context.

## What Dory does differently

**Four memory types, all in one place**

| Type | What it stores | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Episodic | Past events, sessions, experiences | ✓ |
| Semantic | Facts, preferences, entities, relationships | ✓ |
| Procedural | Skills, workflows, repeatable processes | ✓ |
| Working | In-context window (managed by your LLM) | — |

**Spreading activation retrieval** — not vector similarity search. Relevant memories pull in connected memories through the graph. "AllergyFind" activates "Giovanni's" activates "FastAPI" activates "menu endpoint" because those things co-occurred. That's how human memory works.

**Cacheable prefix output** — instead of regenerating your full memory context every turn (which blows prompt caching), Dory splits output into a *stable prefix* (same until memory actually changes) and a *dynamic suffix* (query-specific). Result: cache hits every turn. 4–10x cheaper to run agents with memory than without.

**Principled forgetting** — three decay zones: active, archived, expired. Scores based on recency + frequency + relevance. Nothing is ever deleted — archived memories are queryable for historical context. No other production memory library ships this.

**Bi-temporal conflict resolution** — when a fact changes, the old version is archived with a `SUPERSEDES` edge and a timestamp. You can query "what was true in January" and get the right answer.

**Zero-server stack** — everything runs in a single SQLite file. `sqlite-vec` for vectors, FTS5 for keyword search, adjacency tables for the graph. No Postgres, no Neo4j, no Redis. Works offline.

## Quick start

```python
from dory import DoryMemory

# Works with any model — local or cloud
mem = DoryMemory()                                          # manual observations only
mem = DoryMemory(extract_model="qwen3:14b")                 # local via Ollama
mem = DoryMemory(                                           # Claude
    extract_model="claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
    extract_backend="anthropic",
    extract_api_key="sk-ant-...",
)
mem = DoryMemory(                                           # GPT / Grok / any compat
    extract_model="gpt-4o-mini",
    extract_backend="openai",
    extract_api_key="sk-...",
)

# --- Query context at session start ---
context = mem.query("menu endpoint authentication")   # inject into system prompt

# --- Or build API-ready messages with prompt caching ---
result = mem.build_context("menu endpoint authentication")
messages = result.as_anthropic_messages(user_query)   # Anthropic SDK w/ cache_control
messages = result.as_openai_messages(user_query)      # OpenAI / compat

# --- Log turns during the session ---
mem.add_turn("user", "I'm working on AllergyFind today, need to add a menu endpoint")
mem.add_turn("assistant", "What authentication approach are you using?")

# --- Or add memories manually ---
mem.observe("User prefers JWT for API auth", node_type="PREFERENCE")

# --- End of session: extract, consolidate, decay ---
stats = mem.flush()
```

### MCP server (Claude Code / Claude Desktop)

```bash
pip install 'dory-memory[mcp]'

# Register globally across all Claude Code projects
claude mcp add --scope user dory -- dory-mcp

# Or with a specific DB path
claude mcp add --scope user dory -- dory-mcp --db /path/to/engram.db
```

Five tools are exposed: `dory_query`, `dory_observe`, `dory_consolidate`, `dory_visualize`, `dory_stats`.

---

### Framework adapters

**LangChain** — drop-in `BaseMemory` replacement:

```python
from dory.adapters.langchain import DoryMemoryAdapter
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

memory = DoryMemoryAdapter(
    extract_model="claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
    extract_backend="anthropic",
    extract_api_key="sk-ant-...",
)
chain = ConversationChain(llm=ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-6"), memory=memory)
```

**LangGraph** — graph nodes with the `(state) -> state` signature:

```python
from dory.adapters.langgraph import DoryMemoryNode, MemoryState
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

mem = DoryMemoryNode(extract_model="claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", extract_backend="anthropic")

builder = StateGraph(MemoryState)
builder.add_node("load_memory", mem.load_context)   # or mem.aload_context for async
builder.add_node("record_turn", mem.record_turn)
builder.add_edge(START, "load_memory")
builder.add_edge("load_memory", "record_turn")
builder.add_edge("record_turn", END)
graph = builder.compile()
```

**Multi-agent** — shared memory pool with thread-safe writes and agent attribution:

```python
from dory.adapters.multi_agent import SharedMemoryPool

pool = SharedMemoryPool(db_path="shared.db")
pool.observe("User prefers dark mode", agent_id="agent-1")
pool.add_turn("user", "Let's ship it", agent_id="agent-2", session_id="s1")
results = pool.query("UI preferences")
agent_nodes = pool.get_agent_nodes("agent-1")
```

### Async API

All `DoryMemory` methods have async counterparts — safe to await from FastAPI, LangGraph, and any async framework:

```python
context = await mem.aquery("current topic")
result  = await mem.abuild_context("current topic")
await mem.aadd_turn("user", "message")
node_id = await mem.aobserve("User prefers JWT", node_type="PREFERENCE")
stats   = await mem.aflush()
```

### Export / import

```python
from dory.export.jsonld import JSONLDExporter

exporter = JSONLDExporter(graph)
exporter.export("memory.jsonld.json")           # write to file
data = exporter.export()                         # or get dict

JSONLDExporter.import_into(graph, "memory.jsonld.json")   # round-trip import
```

### Advanced: direct pipeline access

```python
from dory import Graph, Observer, Prefixer

graph = Graph("myapp.db")
obs = Observer(graph, backend="ollama", model="qwen3:14b")
p = Prefixer(graph)
# ... same as DoryMemory but with full control
```

---

## How it works

### Knowledge graph

Every piece of information is a node. Nodes have types: `ENTITY`, `CONCEPT`, `EVENT`, `PREFERENCE`, `BELIEF`, `PROCEDURE`. Edges between them are typed and weighted: `USES`, `WORKS_ON`, `PREFERS`, `SUPERSEDES`, `CO_OCCURS`, etc.

Salience is computed, not assigned:
```
salience = α × connectivity + β × activation_frequency + γ × recency
```

High-salience nodes become **core memories** — they anchor the stable context prefix.

### Observer

Every N conversation turns (configurable), the Observer calls a local LLM to extract structured memories from the raw conversation. Extractions have confidence scores — anything below the threshold is logged but not written to the graph, guarding against false memory.

Backends: Ollama (default), Anthropic (Claude), or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (llama.cpp, Clanker, vLLM, GPT, Grok, etc.).

### Prefixer

Builds context in two parts:

```
[stable prefix]         ← core memories + key relationships
                          same bytes across turns → prompt cache hits

[dynamic suffix]        ← spreading activation for this specific query
                          + recent episodic observations
                          changes per query but small
```

### Decayer

Runs periodically to score every node:
```
score = recency_weight  × exp(-λ × days_since_activation)
      + frequency_weight × log(1 + activation_count)
      + relevance_weight × salience
```

Nodes below the active floor → archived. Below the archive floor → expired. Core memories are shielded with a configurable multiplier.

### Reflector

Finds near-duplicate nodes (Jaccard similarity), merges them keeping the higher-salience one. Detects supersession (same subject, newer fact), archives the old node, and adds a `SUPERSEDES` provenance edge. Old observations are compressed into summaries.

## Local LLM setup

Dory defaults to Ollama for LLM-based extraction (Observer) and embedding (vector search).

```bash
# Pull the default models
ollama pull qwen3:14b          # extraction
ollama pull nomic-embed-text   # embeddings (768-dim, offline after pull)
```

OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Clanker, llama.cpp server, vLLM):
```python
obs = Observer(
    graph,
    backend="openai",
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    model="qwen3",
)
```

Vector search activates automatically once `nomic-embed-text` is available. Falls back to FTS5 BM25 + substring search if no embedding model is running.

---

## Decay zones

| Zone | Behavior | How to query |
|---|---|---|
| `active` | Retrieved in all normal queries | `graph.all_nodes()` (default) |
| `archived` | Invisible to normal queries | `graph.all_nodes(zone="archived")` |
| `expired` | Completely invisible | `graph.all_nodes(zone=None)` |

Nothing is ever deleted. Archived nodes retain full provenance and can be restored if reactivated.

## Research basis

Dory draws from:
- [MemGPT: Towards LLMs as Operating Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560) — two-tier memory architecture
- [Zep: A Temporal Knowledge Graph Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956) — bi-temporal provenance
- [MAGMA: Multi-Graph based Agentic Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03236) — multi-graph retrieval
- [Mastra Observational Memory](https://mastra.ai/research/observational-memory) — cacheable prefix architecture (Python port)
- [LongMemEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813) (ICLR 2025) — the benchmark we care about. Published scores: Mem0 68.4%, Zep 71.2%, Mastra 94.87% (GPT-5-mini). Dory scores **54.4% overall with Haiku** (extract + answer), up from 18.4% before the episodic layer. Per-type: knowledge-update 65.4%, multi-session 60.2%, single-session-user 80.0%, single-session-assistant 50.0%, single-session-preference 46.7%, temporal-reasoning 32.3%. With Sonnet for extraction: temporal-reasoning reaches **64.0%** on a 50-question sample, multi-session reaches **76.0%** on a 25-question sample. Full Sonnet run pending.
